# House-Price-Prediction
California House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

Project Overview

This project implements an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict median house prices in California using socioeconomic and geographic features. The goal is to compare a baseline linear model with a non-linear ensemble model and analyze their performance on real-world housing data.

Dataset

Source: California Housing Dataset (CSV version)

Records: ~20,000 housing blocks

Target Variable: median_house_value

Features Include:

Median income

Housing median age

Total rooms & bedrooms

Population & households

Latitude & longitude

Ocean proximity (categorical)

Problem Statement

Predict the median house value for a given region based on demographic and geographic features, and evaluate how different machine learning models perform on this regression task.

Tools & Technologies

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

NumPy, Pandas

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Methodology
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing

Removed missing values

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)

One-hot encoded the categorical feature ocean_proximity

Split data into training and testing sets (80/20)

2️⃣ Feature Scaling

Applied StandardScaler for Linear Regression

No scaling applied for Random Forest (tree-based model)

3️⃣ Models Implemented

Linear Regression (baseline model)

Random Forest Regressor (ensemble model)

4️⃣ Evaluation Metrics

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

R² Score

Results

Model	RMSE ($)	R² Score
Linear Regression	69,298	0.649
Random Forest	48,768	0.826

Key Observations

Random Forest reduced prediction error by ~30% compared to Linear Regression.

The ensemble model explained over 82% of the variance in housing prices.

Median income and geographic location were the most influential features.

Feature Importance

Feature importance analysis using Random Forest revealed:

Median Income as the strongest predictor

Latitude & Longitude capturing location-based price variation

Ocean proximity significantly influencing housing prices

This improves model interpretability and provides actionable insights.
